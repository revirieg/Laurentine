# AI recreations of Laurentine 

This repository contains text and images used or produced in the exploration of AI recreations of Laurentine (Pliny´s Villa). 
This villa was described by Pliny the younger in a letter to Gallus and no longer exists, over the centuries it has been recreated by artists and architects. In this project we explore the recreation of the villa using emerging text to image AI tools. The main findings have been summarized on this paper:

Elena Merino-Gómez, Fernando Moral, Gomzalo Martínez and Pedro Reviriego, "Recreating Pliny’s Villa at Laurentum with Artificial Intelligence" (under review). 

that is currently under review in TBD.

The repository is structured as follows:

Docs:

- English translation of the letter used for the recreations.
- Description of the text segmentation done on the letter to obtain the inputs to the AI tools.
- A copy of the paper with the analysis of the results. 

Artists Recreations:

- A table with the recreations of the villa done over time and links to the drawings generated by the different architects and artists.  
- Images of the different recreations of Laurentine done over time by different artists and architects.

AI Recreations:

- Text inputs used.
- Images generated by the DALL-E2 tool.
- Images generated by the Midjourney tool.
