--seed  435667 The allee of this ancient Roma villa is encompassed with a box-tree hedge, and where that is decayed, with rosemary; for the box in those parts which are sheltered by the buildings, preserves its verdure perfectly well: but where by an open situation it lies exposed to the winds and to the dashing sea-water, though at a great distance, it entirely withers. Between the garden and this allee runs a shady walk of vines, soft and yielding to the tread, even when you walk bare-foot. The garden is thickly planted with fig and mulberry trees, to which this soil is as favourable as it is averse to all others.
