--seed  435667 Crowning the terrace, portico, and garden  of this Roman villa, stands a detached building, which I call my favourite (amores mei): and in truth I am extremely fond of it, as I erected it myself. It contains a very warm winter-room (heliocaminus), one side of which looks upon the terrace, the other has a view of the sea, and both lie exposed to the sun; and a chamber looking by folding-doors upon the enclosed portico and by a window on the sea. Against the middle wall stands a little elegant retired closet (zotheca), which by means of glass doors and a curtain, is either laid into the adjoining room, or separated from it. It holds a couch (lectum) and two chairs (duas cathedras). As you lie upon this couch, from the feet you have a prospect of the sea; if you look behind, you see the neighbouring villa; and from the head you have a view of the woods: these three views may be seen either distinctly from so many different windows in the room, or blended together in one confused prospect. Adjoining to this, is a bed-chamber (cubiculum noctis et somni), which neither the voice of the servants, the murmur of the sea, nor even the roaring of a tempest can reach; not lightning nor the day itself can penetrate it, unless you open the windows. This profound tranquillity is occasioned by a passage, which divides the wall of this chamber from that of the garden, and thus, by means of that void intervening space (interiacem androne parietem), every noise is drowned. Annexed, is a small stove-room  (hypocaustum), which, by opening a little window, warms the bed-chamber to the degree of heat required. Beyond this lie a chamber (cubiculum) and ante-chamber (procoeton) which catch the rising sun and enjoy it, though obliquely indeed, till the afternoon.
