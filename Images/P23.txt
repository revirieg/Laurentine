--seed  435667 Before this gallery (cryptoporticus) lies a terrace (xystus) perfumed with violets, and warmed by the reflection of the sun from the gallery (cryptoporticus), which as it retains the rays, so it keeps off the north-east wind; and it is as warm on this side, as it is cool on the opposite: in the same manner it is a defence against the south-west, and thus in short, by means of its several sides, breaks the force of the winds from what point soever they blow. These are some of the winter advantages of this building, which however has still more considerable in the summer; for at that season the cryptoporticus throws a shade upon the terrace during all the forenoon, as it defends the nearest part of the allee and garden from the afternoon sun, and casts a greater or less shade either way as the day either increases or decreases; but the portico [cryptoporticus] itself is then shadiest when the sun is most scorching, that is, when its rays fall directly upon the roof. To these advantages I must not forget to add, that by setting open the windows, the western breezes have a free draught, and by that means the enclosed air is prevented from stagnating.
