--seed  435667 The handsome enough dining-room of this Roman villa runs out towards the sea; so that when a south-west wind drives the sea shoreward, it is gently washed by the edge of the last breakers (wave that breaks). On every side of this room there are either folding doors or windows equally large, by which means you have a view from the front and the sides, as it were of three different seas; from the back part you see the middle court, the portico and the area; and by another view you look through the portico into the atrium, from whence the prospect is terminated by the woods and mountains which are seen at a distance.
